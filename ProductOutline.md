PokeWave Product Outline

Pokewave is a website / web app I want to make from scratch

It will select two random Pok√©mon with random levels and use pokemon showdown to simulate them battling 1000 times

the user will guess how many times pokemon A defeats pokemon B and receive a score based on their result.


Eventual Features:
    - Pokemon sprites are rendered on the web app with their information / stats
    - Pokemon showdown is used to simulate 1000's of battles quickly
    - Random Levels for the pokemon
    - Selectable Generation (e.g. gen 2 battle mechanics)
    - Items held by pokemon
    - Realistic Moveset - vs random moveset
    - Random AI or Eleite trainer AI
    - Survival Mode where the acceptable margin of error decreses over time, the user is challenged to see how many in a row they can guess correctly
    - Daily mode, where 10 battles are presented for everyone using the site and get scored
    - Leaderboards
    - Login (Oauth or otherwise)

The App will begin development without requiring any login until features are built out.
The first feature will be showing 2 pokemon to the user and the battle simulation results.
